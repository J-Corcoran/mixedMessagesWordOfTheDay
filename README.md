# mixedMessagesWordOfTheDay
Random Message Generator which produces a random "Unusual" word of the day &amp; it's definition. 

##Outline:

JavaScript program which will generate a new 'unusual' random word and definition supposedly based on your name (although this actually has no impact but I introduced for some interactivity). 

This will be based in the command line.

##How to use:
1. run the code - enter your name and press enter. 
2. Enjoy your random word for the day.
